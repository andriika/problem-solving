# https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/

# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

# Example:
# Input: 4
# Output: [
#   [
#       ".Q..",  // Solution 1
#       "...Q",
#       "Q...",
#       "..Q."
#   ],
#   [
#       "..Q.",  // Solution 2
#       "Q...",
#       "...Q",
#       ".Q.."
#   ]

def isvalid(state, i):
    '''
    Validates i-th element in a given state based on previous elements of the state.
    The state is an integer array representing queens placement. For example, let state be [3,0,1,2]. 
    This means we have following 4x4 board:

        . . . Q
        Q . . .
        . Q . .
        . . Q .

    Let's validate a second row (i=1). It is valid, because no queens above second row (i.e. first row queen) 
    can attack. The function returns True.

    Now, let's validate third row placement (i=2). It's invalid. First row queen can't attack, but 
    second row queen attacks. The function returns False.
